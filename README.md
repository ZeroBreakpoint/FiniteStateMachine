# FiniteStateMachine
This is my C++, raylib project showcasing a Finite State Machine implementation for NPC AI in a game environment. The green agent is the player, the blue agent is always wandering and the yellow agent changes colour based on behaviour. (Left click sets the start node and right click sets the end node).
